<h2 align="center" dir="auto"> Overview </h2>

<p dir="auto">This dialogue system was created with the purpose to help aid game developers and game designers produce quality dialogue and a functioning system that is easy to use and integrate into projects. <strong>You must please be sure to include my name in the credits if you intend to publish your projects with my system.</strong> This system is designed for dynamic and expressive storytelling dialogue. With that goal in mind there are several prefab assets that are styled in different ways to help give the dialogue a variety of styles when speech in game takes place.


This asset pack is helpful for beginners and seasoned developers and designers to get their ideas and concepts out of the brainstorming and storyboarding phase. With this system it will allow for easy transitions between being active and disabled and also introduce a creative and expressive feel to the dialogue of any project.</p>

<p>This asset package has in total <strong>6 prefab assets</strong>. All for a specific purpose and/or aesthetic design style. The different canvases allow for developers to create dynamic ui dialogue and implement animations to the profile image icons at specific points in the dialogue to help portray emotion.</p>
